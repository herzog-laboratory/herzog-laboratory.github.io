## Project Overview

MoleculeAI is a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to revolutionize small molecule drug discovery. By integrating cutting-edge AI models with experimental validation, we're reducing the time and cost of identifying promising therapeutic compounds from years to months.

## Research Motivation

Traditional drug discovery takes 10-15 years and costs $2.6 billion per approved drug, with a 90% failure rate. Our platform addresses key bottlenecks:

- **Target Identification**: Finding druggable proteins in disease pathways
- **Lead Optimization**: Improving drug properties while maintaining efficacy  
- **ADMET Prediction**: Assessing absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity
- **Drug-Drug Interactions**: Preventing adverse interactions in combination therapies

## Technical Approach

### Graph Neural Networks for Molecules
- **Molecular Representation**: Molecules as graphs with atoms as nodes, bonds as edges
- **Message Passing**: Information propagation through molecular structure
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Simultaneous prediction of multiple molecular properties

### Large-Scale Datasets
- **ChEMBL Database**: 2M+ bioactivity measurements
- **Drug Bank**: FDA-approved drugs with known targets and properties
- **Patent Literature**: Mining chemical structures from pharmaceutical patents

### Experimental Validation
