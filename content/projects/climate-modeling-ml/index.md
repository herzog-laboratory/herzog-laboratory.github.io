## Project Mission

ClimateAI combines cutting-edge machine learning with climate science to address humanity's greatest challenge: understanding and mitigating climate change. Our interdisciplinary approach improves climate predictions, accelerates clean energy solutions, and informs climate policy.

## Global Climate Challenge

Climate change poses unprecedented risks to human civilization:
