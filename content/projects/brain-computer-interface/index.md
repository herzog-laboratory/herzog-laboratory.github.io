## Project Vision

NeuroLink AI is pioneering the next generation of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that seamlessly translate neural signals into digital commands. Our mission is to restore independence and quality of life for patients with paralysis, ALS, stroke, and other neurological conditions.

## Medical Need

Neurological disorders affect millions globally:
- **Spinal Cord Injury**: 300,000+ Americans living with paralysis
- **ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)**: 30,000+ patients losing motor function
- **Stroke**: 800,000+ survivors with lasting disabilities annually
- **Locked-in Syndrome**: Patients conscious but unable to move or speak

Current assistive technologies are limited by:
- Low bandwidth communication (2-3 bits/second)
- Poor signal stability over time
- Invasive surgical procedures
- Limited functionality and user experience

## Technical Innovation
