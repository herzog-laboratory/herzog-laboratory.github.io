## Project Overview

CancerSeq AI represents a paradigm shift in precision oncology, using artificial intelligence to analyze complex genomic data from cancer patients. Our goal is to identify personalized treatment strategies by understanding tumor evolution, drug resistance mechanisms, and patient-specific biomarkers.

## Clinical Motivation

Cancer remains a leading cause of death globally, largely due to:
- **Tumor Heterogeneity**: Diverse cell populations within tumors respond differently to treatment
- **Drug Resistance**: Cancers evolve to evade therapeutic interventions
- **Treatment Selection**: Limited tools for choosing optimal therapy combinations
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Need for predictive markers of treatment response

Our AI-powered approach addresses these challenges through comprehensive genomic analysis and machine learning-driven insights.

## Research Approach
