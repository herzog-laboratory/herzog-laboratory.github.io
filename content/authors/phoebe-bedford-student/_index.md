Phoebe joined the lab for a six-week placement, supported by a [British Society for Research on Ageing studentship](https://bsra.org.uk/), from July - August 2025. During this time, Phoebe worked on setting up a pilot study on methylation analysis of non-invasive samples in the TwinsUK cohort. After her placement, Phoebe returned to Oxford to enter her final year of University.
