## Overview
One of the core research interests is understanding how our lifetime exposures shape our epigenome, and how epigenetic ageing arises within organs and cell types of an individual.

## Key questions
- How do exposures influence DNA methylation profiles?
- Do exposure patterns differ by cell type?
- Is there discordance in ageing patterns within individuals?
