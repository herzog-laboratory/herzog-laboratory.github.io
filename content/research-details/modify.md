## Overview
Can we modify ageing trajectories and cell function through targeted epigenetic interventions? Bridging experrimental and computational biology, our core focus in this theme of work is **stem cell biology**.

## Key questions
- Do epigenetic alterations underlie changes in stem cell function?
- Can we engineer epigenetic memories and thereby improve stem cell function?
