## Overview
How can we leverage the epigenome to understand ageing and system-specific vulnerabilities?

Our research explores whether DNA methylation profiles in non-invasive samples can be used to measure current health and predict future adverse outcomes.

## Key questions
- Which sample types are most useful for DNA methylation-based disease risk prediction?
- Can molecular tools improve early risk stratification for adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, or metabolic?
- Does the performance of molecular biomarkers generalise to broad populations?
