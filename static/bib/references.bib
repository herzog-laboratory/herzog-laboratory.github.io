	abstract = {{Recent epigenome-wide studies have identified a large number of genomic regions that consistently exhibit changes in their methylation status with aging across diverse populations, but the functional consequences of these changes are largely unknown. On the other hand, transcriptomic changes are more easily interpreted than epigenetic alterations, but previously identified age-related gene expression changes have shown limited replicability across populations. Here, we develop an approach that leverages high-resolution multi-omic data for an integrative analysis of epigenetic and transcriptomic age-related changes and identify genomic regions associated with both epigenetic and transcriptomic age-dependent changes in blood. Our results show that these multi-omic aging genes in blood are enriched for adaptive immune functions, replicate more robustly across diverse populations and are more strongly associated with aging-related outcomes compared to the genes identified using epigenetic or transcriptomic data alone. These multi-omic aging genes may serve as targets for epigenetic editing to facilitate cellular rejuvenation.}},

However, a small proportion of women test positive despite the absence of these cancers. The aim of this study was to explore the biological and clinical characteristics associated with such WID‐qEC‐positive cases to inform potential follow‐up strategies. We analyzed 1269 cervico‐vaginal samples from women without endometrial or cervical cancer, including healthy controls (n = 624), women with benign gynecological conditions (n = 324), and ovarian cancer cases (n = 321). Of the 80 WID‐qEC‐positive results, 43 (54\%) were from women with ovarian cancer. WID‐qEC positivity was associated with the presence of ovarian cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.93; 95\% CI 1.75–4.95) and with a higher number of lifetime ovulatory cycles (adjusted OR 2.67; 95\% CI 1.06–7.50), a known ovarian cancer risk factor. Both associations were independent of age, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy usage, or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that in the absence of endometrial or cervical cancer, WID‐qEC positivity may indicate an elevated risk or presence of ovarian cancer. While the standalone positive predictive value (PPV) for ovarian cancer detection remains low in the general population, we outline how WID‐qEC could be used in a two‐step triage approach. In women presenting with abnormal bleeding, combining WID‐qEC positivity with a highly specific plasma‐based cell‐free DNA methylation test (e.g., with 60\%–80\% sensitivity and \textbackslashtextasciitilde98.4\% specificity) could theoretically yield a PPV of around 30\%–40\%. This hypothetical modeling is intended solely to illustrate how WID‐qEC positivity might inform future triage research, rather than to propose a clinical diagnostic algorithm. The DNA methylation‐based WID‐qEC test has been validated for the accurate detection of endometrial and cervical cancers using cervico‐vaginal samples. However, a small proportion of women test positive despite the absence of these cancers. This study explored the associated biological and clinical characteristics to inform potential follow‐up strategies. The results showed that in the absence of endometrial or cervical cancer, WID‐qEC test positivity may indicate an elevated risk or the presence of ovarian cancer.

Participants were sampled up to four times across seven tissues and fluids, generating >3,450 biospecimens with harmonised DNA methylation, metabolomics, microbiome, and immune profiling, alongside skin histology, barrier measurements, and rich clinical metadata. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset through: (i) multi-omics-wide association studies linking traits to molecular features; (ii) integrative factor modelling revealing coordinated cross-tissue signatures; (iii) epigenetic-biomarker cross-omic associations, and (iv) CpG-level variance decomposition mapping stable, individual-specific, tissue-restricted, and intervention-responsive methylation patterns. We further show that ageing-linked features are selectively malleable: highly compliant intermittent fasting participants exhibited attenuated or even age-opposing molecular trajectories within six months. The atlas enables unprecedented within-cohort comparisons across omic layers and tissues, supporting discovery of context-dependent biomarkers, cross-system coordination, and intervention responsiveness. Data are available via an interactive portal, with sensitive data under controlled access (https://eutops.github.io/lifestyle-atlas/).

Here, we present a six-month longitudinal IF intervention in 114 women (BMI 25-35) with deep clinical, molecular, and microbiome profiling across >3,400 biospecimens from six tissues. Analyses spanning >2,200 multi-omic features and 11,000 microbial function predictions demonstrate coordinated clinical benefits, including improvements in body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness, and reveal coordinated molecular responses across tissues. Iron metabolism emerged as a central axis: transferrin increased while ferritin, haemoglobin, and erythrocytes decreased, changes that opposed ageing trajectories yet remained within physiological limits. Epithelial DNA methylation biomarkers (cervical, buccal) of cancer risk reduced, while blood clocks were largely unresponsive, underscoring tissue-specificity of the epigenome. Immune profiling uncovered dynamic, partially reversible shifts. Notably, we derived a new immunophenotyping-based ImmuneAge score that increased during fasting and tracked with inflammatory function, while the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A declined selectively in postmenopausal women. Oral microbiota showed rapid restructuring, whereas gut microbiota shifted more subtly toward enhanced metabolic capacity. Together, these data provide unprecedented insight into the systemic and tissue-specific responses to IF in humans and identify iron homeostasis and immune remodelling as candidate mechanisms. Our findings are available through the Lifestyle Atlas (https://eutops.github.io/lifestyle-atlas).

Here, we report the first human longitudinal multi-omic study of smoking cessation, evaluating 2,501 unique single or composite features from 1,094 longitudinal samples. Our comprehensive analysis, leveraging over half a million longitudinal data points, revealed a profound effect of smoking cessation on epigenetic biomarkers and microbiome features across multiple organ systems within 6 months of smoking cessation, alongside shifts in the immune and blood oxygenation system. Moreover, our multi-omic analysis provided unprecedented granularity that allows for identification of new cross-ome associations for mechanistic discovery.

Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation (DNAme) changes are a hallmark of aging and form the basis of so-called epigenetic clocks, yet their functional relevance and directionality in different organs during disease development is often unclear. Here, we link cell-specific age-related DNAme changes with three key hallmarks of aging and cancer (senescence, promoter methylation in genes associated with stem cell fate, and dysregulated proliferation) to comprehensively dissect their association with current and future cancer development, carcinogen exposure or preventive measures, and mortality using data in different organs from over 12,510 human and 105 mouse samples, benchmarking against existing epigenetic clocks. Our findings offer insights into the association of functionally enriched groups of age-related DNAme changes with cancer, identify sites perturbed earliest during carcinogenesis, as well as those distinct between cancer and reprogramming that could inform strategies to prevent teratoma formation upon in vivo reprogramming. Surprisingly, both mouse and human data reveal accelerated aging in breast cancer tissue but decelerated epigenetic aging in some non-cancer surrogate samples from breast cancer patients, in particular cervical samples.

Here we show that the ability of traditional aging clocks to predict chronological age does not correlate with mortality prediction capacity (R = 0.12, P = 0.67), suggesting that these metrics capture distinct biological processes. We developed Biolearn, an open-source framework enabling standardized evaluation of 39 biomarkers across over 20,000 individuals from diverse cohorts. The Horvath skin and blood clock achieved the highest chronological age accuracy (R2 = 0.88), while GrimAge2 demonstrated the strongest mortality association (hazard ratio = 2.57) and healthspan prediction (hazard ratio = 2.00). Our systematic evaluation reveals considerable heterogeneity in biomarker performance across different clinical outcomes, with optimal biomarkers varying according to specific application. Biolearn provides unified data processing pipelines with quality control and cell-type deconvolution capabilities, establishing a foundation for reproducible aging research and facilitating development of robust aging biomarkers.}},

In recent years, many promising molecular and omic BOA have emerged with an enormous potential for translational geroscience and improving healthspan. However, clinical translation remains limited, in part due to the gap between preclinical research and the application of BOA in clinical research and other translational settings. We surveyed experts in these areas to better understand current challenges for the translation of aging biomarkers. We identified six key barriers to clinical translation and developed guidance for the field to overcome them. Core recommendations include linking BOA to clinically actionable insights, improving affordability and availability to broad populations and validation of biomarkers that are robust and responsive at the level of individuals. Our work provides key insights and practical recommendations to overcome barriers impeding clinical translation of BOA. Biomarkers of aging have potential to accelerate the clinical translation of interventions that promote healthy aging but are currently limited to research.

In the analysis of all 2,377 HPV-positive samples, a combination of WID-qCIN (with a predefined threshold) and HPV16 and/or HPV18 (HPV16/18) detected 93.4\% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and 100\% of invasive CCs. The WID-qCIN/HPV16/18 combination predicted 69.4\% of incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse compared with 18.2\% predicted by cytology. Cytology or WID-qCIN/HPV16/18 triage would require 4.1 and 2.4 colposcopy referrals to detect one cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse, respectively, during the 6 year period. These findings support the use of WID-qCIN/HPV16/18 as an improved triage strategy for HPV-positive women. In a real-world Swedish cohort of 28,017 women, screening for cervical cancer using a DNA methylation-based tool, the WID-qCIN test, either alone or in combination with HPV16/18 genotyping, showed better performance than cytology in triaging HPV-positive women.}},

Here, we applied computational deconvolution methods to dissect the cell- and tissue-specific epigenetic effects of tobacco or e-cigarette use on DNA methylation (DNAme) in over 3,500 buccal/saliva, cervical, or blood samples, spanning epithelial and immune cells at directly and indirectly exposed sites. The 535 identified smoking-related DNAme loci (CpGs) clustered into four functional groups, including detoxification or growth signaling, based on cell type and anatomical site. Loci hypermethylated in buccal epithelial cells of smokers associated with NOTCH1/RUNX3/growth factor receptor signaling also exhibited elevated methylation in cancer tissue and progressing lung carcinoma in situ lesions, and hypermethylation of these sites predicted lung cancer development in buccal samples collected from smokers up to 22 years prior to diagnosis, suggesting a potential role in driving carcinogenesis. Alarmingly, these CpGs were also hypermethylated in e-cigarette users with a limited smoking history. This study sheds light on the cell type-specific changes to the epigenetic landscape induced by smoking-related products.}},

Early detection of these cancers is critical and poor performance of ultrasound in black women may contribute to adverse outcomes. Limited data on this topic are available from Africa. We assessed whether a simple DNA methylation test, the WID‐qEC, enables detection of all epithelial uterine (endometrial and cervical) cancers in women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in Ghana. Among 118 women ≥40 years presenting with AUB, 106 consented to the study and a cervicovaginal sample was obtained for WID‐qEC testing. Subsequent to ultrasound assessment 102 women had a cervical or endometrial biopsy. Histopathology, ultrasound and WID‐qEC testing were analyzed and compared. Among the 102 volunteers, 8 and 15 were diagnosed with endometrial and cervical cancer (EC and CC), respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was 0.56 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.25–0.86) for sonographic endometrial thickness (ET) and 0.98 (95\% CI 0.94–1.00) for the WID‐qEC test. Sensitivity and specificity of the prespecified ET ≥5 mm were 66.7\% (95\% CI 24.1–94.0) and 22.7 (95\% CI 12.0–38.2) and for the prespecified WID‐qEC SUM‐PMR ≥ 0.3 were 100\% (95\% CI 56.1–100.0) and 76.1 (96\%CI 60.9–86.9), respectively. In addition, 15 CCs were detected by the WID‐qEC test [sensitivity 100\% (95\% CI 74.7–100.0)]. The WID‐qEC test accurately detects both EC and CC in black women presenting with AUB. Endometrial cancer (EC) is increasing significantly among women in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). EC detection may be improved by WID‐qEC testing, a DNA methylation‐based approach, though its use has been limited primarily to Caucasian populations. Here, the authors investigated the ability of WID‐qEC testing to detect endometrial and cervical cancer in black women in Ghana who presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. WID‐qEC testing successfully identified 100\% of endometrial and cervical cancers in the study population. Utilizing simple sample collection and low‐cost, high‐throughput PCR‐based analysis, WID‐qEC is a promising tool for EC detection for all women in LMICs.}},

Simple and objective tools to reliably detect women with EC are urgently needed. We recently developed and validated the DNA methylation (DNAme)‐based women's cancer risk identification—quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for endometrial cancer (WID‐qEC) test that could address this need. Here, we demonstrate that the stability of the WID‐qEC test remains consistent regardless of: (i) the cervicovaginal collection device and sample media used (Cervex brush and PreservCyt or FLOQSwab and eNAT), (ii) the collector of the specimen (gynaecologist‐ or patient‐based), and (iii) the precise sampling site (cervical, cervicovaginal and vaginal). Furthermore, we demonstrate sample stability in eNAT medium for 7 days at room temperature, greatly facilitating the implementation of the test into diagnostic laboratory workflows. When applying FLOQSwabs (Copan) in combination with the eNAT (Copan) sample collection media, the sensitivity and specificity of the WID‐qEC test to detect uterine (i.e., endometrial and cervical) cancers in gynaecologist‐taken samples was 92.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 75.0\%–98.8\%) and 98.6\% (95\% CI = 91.7\%–99.9\%), respectively, whilst the sensitivity and specificity in patient collected self‐samples was 75.0\% (95\% CI = 47.4\%–91.7\%) and 100.0\% (95\% CI = 93.9\%–100.0\%), respectively. Taken together these data confirm the robustness and clinical potential of the WID‐qEC test. Subjective diagnostic tests with modest accuracy, such as cytology or ultrasound, are currently used to assess the likelihood of uterine cancer in women with abnormal bleeding. Here, the authors show that the DNA methylation‐based women's cancer risk identification—quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for endometrial cancer (WID‐qEC) test they have previously developed has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting uterine cancers in symptomatic women irrespective of the sample collection device and medium, sample collector and precise sampling site. Furthermore, they demonstrate the compatibility of the WID‐qEC test used with the Copan sampling system with established diagnostic laboratory workflows, confirming the robustness and clinical potential of the WID‐qEC test.}},

	abstract = {{Since the discovery of a BRCA1 mutation nearly 30 years ago, definitive methods for ovarian cancer-risk reduction has remained unchanged, requiring carriers of a pathogenic mutation to consider undergoing surgical removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries from the ages of 35 to 40 years. The sequelae of these invasive measures include a profound impact on general health, psychological well-being, sexual and reproductive function. Identifying targetable aberrances in BRCA1 mutation carriers, such as sex hormones, or adopting mechanisms aimed at enhancing tumor immunosurveillance may facilitate the reduction of early cancer-promoting events. This is particularly relevant for the fimbrial fallopian tube, where the majority of epithelial ovarian cancers originate. Utilizing a proof-of-concept for potentially targetable aberrances may further the development of non-surgical adjuncts or surveillance methods aimed at cancer-risk reduction for women deferring or declining surgery. Background: Tissue-specificity for fimbrial fallopian tube ovarian carcinogenesis remains largely unknown in BRCA1 mutation carriers. We aimed to assess the cell autonomous and cell-nonautonomous implications of a germline BRCA1 mutation in the context of cancer immunosurveillance of CD3− CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells. Methods: Premenopausal BRCA1 mutation carriers versus age-matched non-carriers were compared. Daily urinary 5β-pregnanediol levels were used to determine progesterone metabolomics across an ovarian cycle. Using peripherally acquired NK cells the cell-mediated cytotoxicity of tumor targets (OVCAR-3, K-562) was determined using live cellular impedance (xCELLigence®) and multicolor flow cytometry. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) immunohistochemistry of cancer-free fallopian tube specimens allowed a comparison of proximal versus distal portions. Utilizing these findings the role of environmental factors relevant to the fimbrial fallopian tube (progesterone, hypoxia) on NK cell functional activity were studied in an ovarian phase-specific manner. Results: BRCA1 mutation carriers demonstrate a differential progesterone metabolome with a phase-specific reduction of peripheral NK cell functional activity. Progesterone exposure further impairs NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, which is reversed with the addition of mifepristone (1.25 µM). The fimbrial fallopian tube demonstrated significantly higher HIF-1α staining, particularly in BRCA1 mutation carriers, reflecting a site-specific ‘hypoxic niche’. Exposure to hypoxic conditions (1\% O2) can further impair tumor cytotoxicity in high-risk carriers. Conclusions: Phase-specific differential NK cell activity in BRCA1 mutation carriers, either systemically or locally, may favor site-specific pre-invasive carcinogenesis. These cumulative effects across a reproductive lifecycle in high-risk carriers can have a detrimental effect further supporting epidemiological evidence for ovulation inhibition.}},

We assessed cfDNAme in regions of ZNF154, C2CD4D and WNT6 via targeted bisulfite sequencing in diagnostic and early detection (preceding diagnosis) settings. Diagnostic samples were obtained via prospective blood collection in cell‐free DNA tubes in a convenience series of patients with a pelvic mass. Early detection samples were matched case‐control samples derived from the UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS). In the diagnostic set (ncases = 27, ncontrols = 41), the specificity of cfDNAme was 97.6\% (95\% CI: 87.1\%‐99.9\%). High‐risk cancers were detected with a sensitivity of 80\% (56.3\%‐94.3\%). Combination of cfDNAme and CA125 resulted in a sensitivity of 94.4\% (72.7\%‐99.9\%) for high‐risk cancers. Despite technical issues in the early detection set (ncases = 29, ncontrols = 29), the specificity of cfDNAme was 100\% (88.1\%‐100.0\%). We detected 27.3\% (6.0\%‐61.0\%) of high‐risk cases with relatively lower genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination. The sensitivity rose to 33.3\% (7.5\%‐70.1\%) in samples taken <1 year before diagnosis. We detected ovarian cancer in several patients up to 1 year before diagnosis despite technical limitations associated with archival samples (UKFOCSS). Combined cfDNAme and CA125 assessment may improve ovarian cancer screening in high‐risk populations, but future large‐scale prospective studies will be required to validate current findings. Our findings indicate that combining cell‐free DNA methylation analysis in three genetic regions with CA125 may improve the sensitivity of ovarian cancer detection in high‐risk women. Women with a positive score in either diagnostic modality, particularly double‐positive individuals, could be referred for a PET‐CT scan to rule out a positive result due to a different cancer, and could undergo surgery even in the absence of a visible ovarian tumour on imaging given the high specificity of cfDNAme.}},

Women in the highest combined risk group (high polygenic risk score and WID™-qtBC) had a 9.6-fold increased risk for BC [95% CI: 4.7–21] compared to the low-risk group and tended to present at more advanced stages. Importantly, the WID™-qtBC is influenced by non-genetic BC risk factors, including age and body mass index, and can be modified by a preventive pharmacological intervention, indicating an interaction between genome and environment recorded at the level of the epigenome. Our findings indicate that methylation levels at mQTLs in relevant surrogate tissues could enable integration of heritable and non-heritable factors for improved disease risk stratification.},

Persistent oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common cause for cervical cancer. Here, we investigate HPV‐induced host epigenome‐wide changes prior to development of cytological abnormalities. Using cervical sample methylation array data from disease‐free women with or without an oncogenic HPV infection, we develop the WID (Women's cancer risk identification)‐HPV, a signature reflective of changes in the healthy host epigenome related to high‐risk HPV strains (AUC=0.78, 95\% CI: 0.72‐0.85, in non‐diseased women). Looking at HPV‐associated changes across disease development, HPV‐infected women with minor cytological alterations (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/2, CIN1/2), but surprisingly not those with precancerous changes or invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+), show an increased WID‐HPV index, indicating the WID‐HPV may reflect a successful viral clearance response absent in progression to cancer. Further investigation revealed the WID‐HPV is positively associated with apoptosis (ρ=0.48; p<0.001) and negatively associated with epigenetic replicative age (ρ=‐0.43; p<0.001). Taken together, our data suggest the WID‐HPV captures a clearance response associated with apoptosis of HPV‐infected cells. This response may be dampened or lost with increased underlying replicative age of infected cells, resulting in progression to cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.}},

Measures to identify women at risk and to detect endometrial cancer earlier are required to reduce the morbidity triggered by the aggressive treatment required for advanced endometrial cancer. We developed the WID‐EC (Women's cancer risk IDentification‐Endometrial Cancer) test, which is based on DNA methylation at 500 CpG sites, in a discovery set of cervical liquid‐based cytology samples from 1086 women with and without an endometrial cancer (217 cancer cases and 869 healthy controls) with a worse prognosis (grade 3 or ≥stage IB). We validated the WID‐EC test in an independent external validation set of 64 endometrial cancer cases and 225 controls. We further validated the test in 150 healthy women (prospective set) who provided a cervical sample as part of the routine Swedish cervical screening programme, 54 of whom developed endometrial cancer within 3 years of sample collection. The WID‐EC test identified women with endometrial cancer with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.88‐0.97) in the external set and of 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.74‐0.89) in the prospective validation set. Using an optimal cutoff, cancer cases were detected with a sensitivity of 86\% and a specificity of 90\% in the external validation set, and a sensitivity and specificity of 52\% and 98\% respectively in the prospective validation set. The WID‐EC test can identify women with or at risk of endometrial cancer. The endometrial cancer incidence is rising, and imaging‐based screening is often not suitably accurate for endometrial cancers. Here, the authors show that a new DNA methylation signature (Women's cancer risk IDentification‐Endometrial Cancer, or WID‐EC) can both detect the presence and predict the risk of endometrial cancer. Together with three other recently‐reported methylation indices that detect breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers (WID‐BC, WID‐OC, and WID‐CIN), WID‐EC completes a list of signatures that can detect/predict all four women‐specific cancers using a single cervical sample and the same technology platform for methylation array‐based tests.}},

We aimed to develop and validate a simple, noninvasive, and reliable triage test for EC to reduce the number of invasive diagnostic procedures and improve patient survival. <br>METHODS: We developed a test to screen and triage women with suspected EC using 726 cervical smear samples from women with and without EC, and validated the test in 562 cervicovaginal samples using three different collection methods (cervical smear: n = 248; vaginal swab: n = 63; and self-collection: n = 251) and four different settings (case/control: n = 388; cohort of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding: n = 63; a cohort of high-risk women with Lynch syndrome: n = 25; and a nested case/control setting from a screening cohort and samples taken up to 3 years before EC diagnosis: n = 86). <br>RESULTS: We describe the Women's cancer risk IDentification – quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for Endometrial Cancer (WID-qEC), a three-marker test that evaluates DNA methylation in gene regions of GYPC and ZSCAN12. In cervical, self-collected, and vaginal swab samples derived from symptomatic patients, it detected EC with sensitivities of 97.2\% (95\% CI, 90.2 to 99.7), 90.1\% (83.6 to 94.6), and 100\% (63.1 to 100), respectively, and specificities of 75.8\% (63.6 to 85.5), 86.7\% (79.3 to 92.2), and 89.1\% (77.8 to 95.9), respectively. The WID-qEC identified 90.9\% (95\% CI, 70.8 to 98.9) of EC cases in samples predating diagnosis up to 1 year. Test performance was similar across menopausal status, age, stage, grade, ethnicity, and histology. <br>CONCLUSION: The WID-qEC is a noninvasive reliable test for triage of women with symptoms suggestive of ECs. Because of the potential for self-collection, it could improve early diagnosis and reduce the reliance for in-person visits.}},

Here, we aimed to develop and validate an automatable triage test that is highly sensitive and specific independently of age and sample heterogeneity, and predicts progression to CIN3+ in HPV+ patients. The WID™-qCIN, assessing three regions in human genes DPP6, RALYL, and GSX1, was validated in both a diagnostic (case–control) and predictive setting (nested case–control), in a total of 761 samples. Using a predefined threshold, the sensitivity of the WID™-qCIN test was 100\% and 78\% to detect invasive cancer and CIN3, respectively. Sensitivity to detect CIN3+ was 65\% and 83\% for women < and ≥ 30 years of age. The specificity was 90\%. Importantly, the WID™-qCIN test identified 52\% of ≥ 30-year-old women with a cytology negative (cyt−) index sample who were diagnosed with CIN3 1–4 years after sample donation. We identified suitable DNAme regions in an epigenome-wide discovery using HPV+ controls and CIN3+ cases and established the WID™-qCIN, a PCR-based DNAme test. The WID™-qCIN test has a high sensitivity and specificity that may outperform conventional cervical triage tests and can in an objective, cheap, and scalable fashion identify most women with and at risk of (pre-)invasive cervical cancer.

HPV testing is highly sensitive but there is currently no high-specificity triage method for colposcopy referral to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or above (CIN3+) in women positive for high-risk (hr) HPV subtypes. An objective, automatable test that could accurately perform triage, independently of sample heterogeneity and age, is urgently required. We analyzed DNA methylation at ~850,000 CpG sites across the genome in a total of 1254 cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples from cases of screen-detected histologically verified CIN1-3+ (98\% hrHPV-positive) and population-based control women free from any cervical disease (100\% hrHPV-positive). Samples were provided by a state-of-the-art population-based cohort biobank and consisted of (i) a discovery set of 170 CIN3+ cases and 202 hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative controls; (ii) a diagnostic validation set of 87 CIN3+, 90 CIN2, 166 CIN1, and 111 hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative controls; and (iii) a predictive validation set of 428 cytology-negative samples (418 hrHPV-positive) of which 210 were diagnosed with CIN3+ in the upcoming 1–4 years and 218 remained disease-free. We developed the WID-CIN (Women’s cancer risk IDentification-Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia) test, a DNA methylation signature consisting of 5000 CpG sites. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) in the independent diagnostic validation set was 0.92 (95\% CI 0.88–0.96). At 75\% specificity (≤CIN1), the overall sensitivity to detect CIN3+ is 89.7\% (83.3–96.1) in all and 92.7\% (85.9–99.6) and 65.6\% (49.2–82.1) in women aged ≥30 and <30. In hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative samples in the predictive validation set, the WID-CIN detected 54.8\% (48.0–61.5) cases developing 1–4 years after sample donation in all ages or 56.9\% (47.6–66.2) and 53.5\% (43.7–63.2) in ≥30 and <30-year-old women, at a specificity of 75\%. The WID-CIN test identifies the vast majority of hrHPV-positive women with current CIN3+ lesions.

A simple, operator‐independent and accurate test to correctly identify women presenting with abnormal bleeding as a consequence of endometrial or cervical cancer is urgently required. We have recently developed and validated the WID‐qEC test, which assesses DNA methylation of ZSCAN12 and GYPC via real‐time PCR, to triage women with symptoms suggestive of endometrial cancer using ThinPrep‐based liquid cytology samples. Here, we investigated whether the WID‐qEC test can additionally identify women with cervical cancer. Moreover, we evaluate the test's applicability in a SurePath‐based hospital‐cohort by comparing its ability to detect endometrial and cervical cancer to cytology. In a set of 23 cervical cancer cases and 28 matched controls the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) is 0.99 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97‐1.00) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 92.9\%, respectively.

Our data suggest that the WID‐qEC test detects both endometrial and cervical cancer with high accuracy. While abnormal vaginal bleeding is a presenting symptom of endometrial and cervical cancers, only a small proportion of women who present with vaginal bleeding have endometrial or cervical cancer. Currently, the tests used to triage women with abnormal bleeding, such as ultrasound or cytology, are subjective and have modest accuracy. Here, the authors demonstrate that a real‐time PCR‐based test, which assesses DNA methylation at three gene regions using a cervical or vaginal sample, is able to identify 100\% of women who have cervical or endometrial cancer with a high specificity (>80\%), irrespective of the sample collection system.}},

	abstract = {{Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in premenopausal women. Progesterone drives expansion of luminal progenitor cells, leading to the development of poor-prognostic breast cancers. However, it is not known if antagonising progesterone can prevent breast cancers in humans. We suggest that targeting progesterone signalling could be a means of reducing features which are known to promote breast cancer formation. In healthy premenopausal women with and without a BRCA mutation we studied (i) estrogen and progesterone levels in saliva over an entire menstrual cycle (n = 20); (ii) cancer-free normal breast-tissue from a control population who had no family or personal history of breast cancer and equivalently from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n = 28); triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) biopsies and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the TNBC in the same individuals (n = 14); and biopsies of ER+ve/PR+ve stage T1--T2 cancers and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the cancer in the same individuals (n = 31); and (iii) DNA methylation and DNA mutations in normal breast tissue (before and after treatment) from clinical trials that assessed the potential preventative effects of vitamins and antiprogestins (mifepristone and ulipristal acetate; n = 44). Daily levels of progesterone were higher throughout the menstrual cycle of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, raising the prospect of targeting progesterone signalling as a means of cancer risk reduction in this population. Furthermore, breast field cancerization DNA methylation signatures reflective of (i) the mitotic age of normal breast epithelium and (ii) the proportion of luminal progenitor cells were increased in breast cancers, indicating that luminal progenitor cells with elevated replicative age are more prone to malignant transformation. The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone reduced both the mitotic age and the proportion of luminal progenitor cells in normal breast tissue of all control women and in 64\% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. These findings were validated by an alternate progesterone receptor antagonist, ulipristal acetate, which yielded similar results. Importantly, mifepristone reduced both the TP53 mutation frequency as well as the number of TP53 mutations in mitotic-age-responders. These data support the potential usage of antiprogestins for primary prevention of poor-prognostic breast cancers.

	abstract = {{The vast majority of epithelial ovarian cancer arises from tissues that are embryologically derived from the M{\"u}llerian Duct. Here, we demonstrate that a DNA methylation signature in easy-to-access M{\"u}llerian Duct-derived cervical cells from women with and without ovarian cancer (i.e. referred to as the Women's risk IDentification for Ovarian Cancer index or WID-OC-index) is capable of identifying women with an ovarian cancer in the absence of tumour DNA with an AUC of 0.76 and women with an endometrial cancer with an AUC of 0.81. This and the observation that the cervical cell WID-OC-index mimics the epigenetic program of those cells at risk of becoming cancerous in BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers (i.e. mammary epithelium, fallopian tube fimbriae, prostate) further suggest that the epigenetic misprogramming of cervical cells is an indicator for cancer predisposition. This concept has the potential to advance the field of risk-stratified cancer screening and prevention. Most ovarian cancers originate from cells originally derived from M{\"u}llerian Duct cells. Here, the authors show that the methylation profile of M{\"u}llerian Duct cells isolated from cervical samples can predict whether a woman has cervical cancer.}},

	abstract = {{A variety of epigenetic clocks utilizing DNA methylation changes have been developed; these clocks are either tissue-independent or designed to predict chronological age based on blood or saliva samples. Whether discordant tick rates between tissue-specific and general epigenetic clocks play a role in health and disease has not yet been explored. Here we analyze 1941 cervical cytology samples, which contain a mixture of hormone-sensitive cervical epithelial cells and immune cells, and develop the WID general clock (Women's IDentification of risk), an epigenetic clock that is shared by epithelial and immune cells and optimized for cervical samples. We then develop the WID epithelial clock and WID immune clock, which define epithelial- and immune-specific clocks, respectively. We find that the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID-REA), defined as the difference between the epithelial and general clocks, is significantly reduced in cervical samples from pre-menopausal women with breast cancer (OR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.28-5.72). We find the same effect in normal breast tissue samples from pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer and show that potential risk reducing anti-progesterone drugs can reverse this. In post-menopausal women, this directionality is reversed. Hormone replacement therapy consistently leads to a significantly lower WID-REA in cancer-free women, but not in post-menopausal women with breast or ovarian cancer. Our findings imply that there are multiple epigenetic clocks, many of which are tissue-specific, and that the differential tick rate between these clocks may be an informative surrogate measure of disease risk.}},
